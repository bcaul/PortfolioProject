            CardioCare was my Leaving Certificate Computer Science project in 2024, for which I received a H1. 
            It is a device designed for individuals with heart conditions, monitoring their heartbeat via a pulse sensor. 
            If the user's BPM reaches a dangerously high or low level, the system notifies the user and automatically contacts emergency 
            services through the CardioCare app.

             <br/>
             The project utilizes an Arduino to collect heartbeat data, which is transmitted via serial port to a Node.js server for 
             storage and processing. The data is then sent to the CardioCare mobile app, built using Dart, where the user can monitor 
             their BPM in real-time. If critical thresholds are detected, the app issues an alert and automatically calls emergency 
             services.

            This project kinda sucks! The pulse sensor was very low quality so it ended up making the app think I was dying over and over again...
            Yeah so don't depend on this to save your life :) I did learn a lot making it though!!!
