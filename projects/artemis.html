                    Artemis III is an AI-based drone that I am working on along with a team based out of the University of Manchester.
                    It focuses on using advanced technologies to enable drone control using hand gestures. It's designed to be intuitive
                     and highly accessible, making it possible for someone to control a drone simply by moving their hands.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The project combines elements of machine learning, computer vision and EMG signals to recognise hand gestures 
                    and translate those gestures into flight commands for the drone, For example, the open palm gesture is mapped to
                    the drone's accension.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Originally the project used computer vision, utilising tools such as mediapipe and openCV to track hand gestures 
                    through a camera. However this had limitations so we transitioned to EMG signals through the use of an myo armband, offering advantages like hands-free
                    control and reliability. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    As the head of drone control, my role included:
                    <br/>• Developing a novel drone control system by classifing hand gestures using machine learning and EMG signals
                    <br/>• Translating gesture inputs into precise, real-time drone commands for intuitive operation.
                    <br/>• Designed and implemented a flight simulator to test and refine drone behavior in a controlled environment.

                    <ul>

                        <li>Create our own EMG sensor, making it so we don't have to rely on a Myo Armband. Our hardware
                            team has already made great progress on this.
                        </li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>
                            Decode the EMG signals into a 3d representation of the hand (real time tracking instead of static gestures)
                        </li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>Create our own drone, so far we have been using a parrot bebop 2 drone.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>Apply for the Eli & Britt Harari Graphene Enterprises grant, which has two significant prizes, one of £50,000 and another of £20,000, 
                            which will be granted to the individuals or cohesive teams who can compellingly demonstrate how their innovative technology, 
                            pertaining to graphene or other 2D materials. Artemis relates to graphene as we are going to be using graphene ink in the 
                            EMG sensor which we will create.
