        <div class="section-container">
           <div class="text-container">
            A real-time face recognition attendance system built with OpenCV and the face_recognition library. 
            It detects and recognizes faces from a webcam feed, compares them with stored images, and logs attendance in a 
            CSV file with timestamps.
            <br/><br/>
            How it works:
            <br/><br/>Basic.py:
            <br/>• loads images and converts them into from BGR into RGB (which is needed for the 
            facial_recognition library).
            <br/>• Faces are found and encoded into numerical representations. The face encodings are then compared decided if the 
            faces belong to the same person aswell as giving a similarity score. 
            <br/><br/>Attendance.py:
            <br/>• Attendance.py extends Basic.py into a real-time application by using a webcam to detect, recognise and log attendance.
            <br/>
