        <div class="section-container">

            <p>The Math with Gestures project allows the user to interact with a system where they can draw using gestures, and the 
                AI will process and understand what they are doing. It can do a variety of things, for example, the user could
                could draw a math equation which the AI will solve, or the user could even draw something and have the AI guess what the drawing
                is. 

                <br/>
                <br/>
                It works by using opencv to track the users hand postion. Then machine learning will classify what gesture the 
                user is making, which will determine if the user is in 'drawing mode' or not. When the drawing is finished, a specific gesture
                will communicate with a generative AI model (gemini 1.5) to process the drawing.
